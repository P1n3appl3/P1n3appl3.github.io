I've been working on [my raytracer](https://github.com/P1n3appl3/ray) on and off for a few months now. Overall it's been wildly fun and educational and I recommend anyone who wants to learn about computer graphics to write one (check out [the links in my readme](https://github.com/P1n3appl3/ray#resources) for some good resources). The tutorial I followed for much of the way was written in "non-modern" C++ (C with classes and operator overloading), but I chose to write it in rust.
