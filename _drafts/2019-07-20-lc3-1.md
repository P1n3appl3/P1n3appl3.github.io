So far when I've written about things it's always been a "post mortem"" format. This is nice because I can spend however long I want on it and have a lot of perspective about the subject. However, when I look at the writing I enjoy most it's often about the _process_ so I thought I'd try to emulate [that](https://jam1.re/blog/camera-hacking-and-emulation) style for once.

I want to build a set of tools for the[LC-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3). What kind of tools you might ask? Definitely an assembler and emulator, but beyond that I'm not sure yet. The end goal is to be able to write some [3D graphics demos](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) and given that the LC-3 is sorely lacking in areas like numeric processing I may have to write some sort of higher level assembler or [forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) to be able to make ASCII rendered rotating polyhedrons without losing my mind. Besides just being cool, I have some external motivation to get this done because I'm TAing for a freshman course next semester and I'd really prefer to not be rusty given that I haven't really touched LC-3 assembly in the past year and a half.

A friend of mine (@chiragsakhuja) has been the head TA for the course and over the last year or two has written an all-in-one cross platform desktop application with an editor, assembler, emulator, and debugger. This is definitely a huge step up from the previous tools provided, but for fun I want to build my own stack.
